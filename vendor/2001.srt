voiceprint identification

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,920
frankly we have had some reliable
intelligence reports that quite a

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,260
serious epidemic programmatically well
there have been some hectic views held

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,470
by some of you regarding the need for
security

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,690
however I accept the need for absolute
secrecy discussed

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,629
we thought it might be the upper part of
some very structure so we excavated out

11
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,930
on all sides but unfortunately we didn't
find anything else and hasn't been

00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,250
covered up by natural erosion or other
forces seems to have been deliberately

that applies half-eaten mile voyage to
the sixth member of the discovery rule

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,49
is the HAL 9000 computer

18
00:01:20,49 --> 00:01:23,799
everything is going extremely well one
gets the sense that he is capable of

19
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,649
emotional responses pile of dead

20
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:32,200
no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake
or distorted information that they have
